### This is a fork based on the Chirpy Jekyll theme.

This blog aims to document my progress within Cybersecurity - by researching, identifying and reporting relevant security vulnerabilities in order to help in the push against cybercrime and criminal exploitation of vulnerabilities in services.

This will cover:
- my progress in certifying my knowledge in security and networking operations;
- my discovery and reporting of vulnerabilities;
- writing my thought process in determining how to deal with security issues;

I will aim to push a blog post every month at minimum, in order to show my consistent progress.
